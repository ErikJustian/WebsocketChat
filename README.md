# WebsocketChat

## How It Works
1. Run IMServer.java
2. Open browser and access localhost:8080 (open at least 2 tabs for the chat function)
3. Input your desired username (Example: Person A & Person B)
4. Click the `people` icon at the top right corner to access the users list.
5. On Person A's view -> click Person B, and input the message via the bottom bar provided.
6. Check if the message did arrive by doing the same on Person B's view.
7. To go offline, just close the corresponding user's view (browser tab). For example, if you close Person B's view, Person B will now appear `offline` on the other person chat view and the user is now removed from the users list.
